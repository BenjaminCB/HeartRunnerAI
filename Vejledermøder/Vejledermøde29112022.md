4.3.3 --> available or reachable AEDs to describe the search for multiple AEDs

4.4.1 --> calculation of fitness for figure

Multigreedy vs NN? - compare results from these two.

Efficiency is how fast the algorithm runs - effictiveness is how the good the tasks are completed

Add consideration and reflexion for future work in the discussion chapter --> runnerscore for example
