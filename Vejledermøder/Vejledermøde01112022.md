Difference between paper and project: Their tasks can be divided into subtasks

Try game theory after midlle of november if the approach we have now does not work. 

Best response fits best from game theory. Set distance as the reward (minimal distance). If total reward does't change we stop (local optimal solution).  
Can also be used as a base line for the experiment. 

Inlcude improvements in the report. Compare if possible. 

The process of exploring the method in ML is more important than the result.
